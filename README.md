 <h1> Introduction: </h1>
 
 <p> This was my second solo project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, completed in 1 week from this brief. (https://gist.github.com/wofockham/42880541c94121516109)

I learnt how plan and execute a larger multi-page web application using Model-view-controller, integrate Ruby gems, deploy and maintain a project on a cloud hosting service (Heroku) and manage test and production databases. </p>
